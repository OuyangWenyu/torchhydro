## Features

-   TODO

## Data source settings

We set a unified data path in settings.json in the `.hydrodataset` directory which is located in the user directory (for example, `C:\Users\username\.hydrodataset` in Windows). You can change the data path in this file.

We have some conventions for data sources and we think it could be better to follow these conventions:

1. Public datasets such as CAMELS are put in the `waterism/datasets-origin` directory.
2. The processed datasets are put in the `waterism/datasets-interim` directory.
3. Some cache files are put in the `.hydrodataset/cache` directory.

We set these conventions in the `settings.json`` file. You can specify by yourself. Don't change the "key" in the JSON file unless you are clear about what you are doing.

## For developers

To install the environment, run the following code in the terminal:

```Shell
conda env create -f env-dev.yml
conda activate torchhydro
```

To use this repository of dev or other branches in your existing environment:

1. you can fork it to your GitHub account. Don't choose "only fork the main branch" when forking in the Github page.
2. run the following code in the terminal:

```Shell
# xxxxxx is your github account; here we choose to use dev branch
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/xxxxxx/torchhydro.git@dev
```

For the dataset we set a unified data path in settings.txt in the `.hydrodataset` directory which is located in the user directory (for example, `C:\Users\username\.hydrodataset` in Windows). You can change the data path in this file.

Then we have some conventions for the dataset:

1. Public datasets such as CAMELS is put in the `waterism/datasets-origin` directory.
2. The processed datasets are put in the `waterism/datasets-interim` directory.

You can specify by yourself, but some changes are needed. We will optimize this part in the future.
